## 🎯 How It Works

When the user clicks on any button or types via the keyboard:

- The corresponding input is added to the calculator’s display.  
- `AC` clears the entire input.  
- `DEL` removes the last entered character.  
- `=` or `Enter` triggers evaluation using JavaScript’s `eval()` function.  
- The UI updates dynamically to show the result or next input.
